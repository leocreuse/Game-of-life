 * @brief Definition of the functions making possible the evolutionary steps of Conway's game of life.
 * 
 * @author LÃ©o Creuse
 * 
 * This is the definitons of the functions enableling the evolutionary steps of the game.\n
 * The API consists of the following functions:\n
 *  -A function to transform all newborn cells in alive cells.\n
 *  -A function to kill (and delete) all dying cells from the population.\n
 *  -A function detemining which dead cells should be reborn due to their neighborhood,
 * 	and adding them to the population as newborns.\n
 *  -A function determining which cells should age and then die due to their neighborhood.\n\n
 * The order in which these functions should be used to complete one evolutionary step is:\n
 *  -all_alive\n
 * 	-kill_dying\n
 *  -age\n
 * 	-renew\n\n
 * All the functions have not been encapsulated into one in order to be able to see the dynamic of the game.
