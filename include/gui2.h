 * @file gui2.h
 * 
 * @brief This file defines the api to show the animation at execution time. It uses the SDL 2.0 library, so it should be installed on the users system.
 * 
 * Note: this basicaly does the same thing than gui.h does, it simply uses the SDL2.0 library instead, which is more recent, and more versatile, but not installed on the CI's computer.\n
 * This enables the user to watch the evolution of the cells directly, without having to 
 * wait for the generation of the cells and the compilation of the gif. It also looks nicer
 * since the cells are more than one pixel wide...
 * 
 * The api is made of:\n
 * 	-A function to initialize the graphical interface.\n
 *  -A function to update the screen according to the state of the population\n
 *  -A function to show the whole animation.\n\n
