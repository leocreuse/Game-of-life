 * 
 * @brief This file defines the api to show the animation at execution time. It uses the SDL 1.2 library, so it should be installed on the user's system.
 * 
 * This enables the user to watch the evolution of the cells directly, without having to 
 * wait for the generation of the cells and the compilation of the gif. It also looks nicer
 * since the cells are more than one pixel wide...\n\n
 * The supported commands at the time are:\n
 * 	-pressing space to pause the animation (assuming pausing is not blocked in the configuration)\n
 * 	-left-clicking anywhere on the screen to toggle the cell under it.\n
 *  -closing the window.\n\n
 * The api is made of:\n
 * 	-A function to initialize the graphical interface.\n
 *  -A function to update the screen according to the state of the population\n
 *  -A function to show the whole animation.\n\n
