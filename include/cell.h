/**
 * @file cell.h
 * 
 * @brief Definition of the cells constituting the alive population
 * 		  of the game of life.
 * 
 * @author LÃ©o Creuse
 * 
 * This is the definition file for the cells constituting the alive 
 * population of the assignment's implementation of Conway's game of life.
 * Each cell contains various informations: it's status, it's position, a list 
 * of pointers to it's neighbors and a pointer to the next cell in the list storing
 * the entire alive population of the simulation.			
 * 
 *  the API is defined as follow:\n
 * 	-a function to initialize an empty population\n
 * 	-a function to create a newborn cell, given it's coordinates\n
 * 	-a function to know the size of the population\n
 * 	-a function to kill the first cell of the population\n
 *  -a function to deallocate the entire population\n
 * 	-a function to print in the console the list of the cells constituting the  
 * 	   population with their coordinates and their status.
